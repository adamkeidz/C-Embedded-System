# C-Embedded-System
This repository contains a project developed for the Embedded System course at Universiti Teknologi Petronas. The project aims to design and implement an embedded system that uses sensors to get feedback from its environment and produce appropriate outputs.

## Project Objective

1. Design and build a microcontroller-based hardware with multiple input-output interfacing.
2. Design and develop an event-driven program that performs prescribed tasks.
3. Apply good design and engineering practices to build a robust and user-friendly embedded system.

## Requirements
The project utilizes the following hardware equipment:
- Nucleo-L411RE development board or equivalent
- LCD (16x2) display
- 7-segment displays
- LEDs (various quantities)
- Switches (including push button type)
- Matrix keypad
- Breadboard (may need more than 1 unit)
- Resistors (various values)
- Jumper wires
- Sensors (as required)

Minimum requirement for inputs and outputs:

Inputs: 1 sensor, 1 push button, 1 switch
Outputs: 1 Text LCD (16x2) display, 2 seven-segment displays, 2 LEDs

The program is implemented in Mbed OS C/C++, utilizing timer interrupts and hardware interrupts.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Mbed OS compatible development environment is required to compile and run the program.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the program using Mbed OS compatible development environment.
4. Run the executable on Nucleo-L411RE development board or equivalent.
